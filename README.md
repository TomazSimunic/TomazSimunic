- 👋 Hi, I’m Tomaž Šimunić
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code and where to use the code and programs that i make
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and C++
- You can reach me on my gmail: tomaz.simunic1@gmail.com

I have finished the school Srednja elektro-računalniška šola Maribor.
During this, I learned programming and system knowledge, some of which I also researched in my spare time.

The languages I learned or used to this day:
- C++
- C# in Unity
- HTML, CSS
- PHP
- SQL
- PHPMyAdmin
- Java
- Python

My knowledge of these languages:

C++ is the language, we used the most in school. I also competed in "17. tekmovanja ACM v znanju računalništva" championship, where I competed, using C++ and achieved 24th place out of 89 contestants.

I finished my final school project using Unity and C#. This project is in my profile under the name Platformer.

Currently I am creating a website using HMTL and CSS, which i was also taught in school.

We also had a year of PHP and Java in school and 2 years of SQL, with some PHPMyAdmin.

I made some small programms using Python, when learning coding.
